C/C++ Scripts for Mathematical Modelling

This project provides an introduction to programming using C and C++, with examples designed to show how computers can be used to solve practical problems in a wide range of different fields.
In particular, I cover the procedural features of these languages, such as:
- Variables
- Arrays
- Loops
- Branching statements 
- Functions

I have also implemented object-oriented programming techniques such as:
- Classes
- Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance

The application of these scripts range from mathematics, the physical sciences and finance.

I have also included a report on how each of the scrpits work with an explanation of each of their context on how they can be utlised.
